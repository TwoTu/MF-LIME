% Construct the radial filter components...

% First construct a low-pass filter that is as large as possible, yet falls
% away to zero at the boundaries.  All log Gabor filters are multiplied by
% this to ensure no extra frequencies at the 'corners' of the FFT are
% incorporated as this seems to upset the normalisation process when
